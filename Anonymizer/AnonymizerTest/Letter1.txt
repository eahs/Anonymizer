Dear Sir or Madam:
 
I write this letter in support of Alex Bloom’s application for the William Shakespeare Poetry Scholarship. I had the pleasure of teaching for her 10th, 11th and 12th grade English Literature and Composition classes at Nevermore High School. She has always impressed me with her ability to articulate difficult concepts and understand dense texts. Her sensitivity to the nuances within literature, and her passion for reading and writing, set her apart both as a student and as a writer.
 
During her senior year, Alex produced an extraordinary research paper on historical literature, in which she compared works from three different time periods and synthesized cultural and historical perspectives to inform her analysis. When called upon to give her presentation in front of her peers, she spoke clearly and thoughtfully, responding to all questions from her peers in an informed manner. While she shows much promise as a student, it is poetry which most interests her. She publishes her poetry in our school’s newspaper and has also had her work published in online journals and blogs.
 
Throughout the year Alex was an active participant in our discussions, and she always supported her peers. Her caring nature and personality allows her to work well in a team, as she always respects the opinions of others. She uses this openness to affect her poetry and to create informed pieces of literature.
 
I am certain that she will continue to do great and creative things in her future. Her work, as I am sure you will agree, demonstrates an impressive depth for someone so young. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions at: vjones@email.com.
 
Sincerely,

Ms. Victoria Jones
