To Whom It May Concern:

Alexander's academic strengths are complemented by his demonstrated leadership skills – he was our band's drum major for two years and served as Vice President of the Student Council and Editor of our high school yearbook. He is also very active in his church and in the Sierra Student Coalition.

	It is with much enthusiasm that I recommend Alex Bloom for inclusion in the College Scholars Program at the University of Tennessee.

I was Alex's instructor for multiple English classes during his four years at Morristown-Hamblen High School, including AP English his junior year. In our classes, Alex displayed a level of creativity, wit, and analytical thought that is quite rare among high school students.

His writing and research skills are truly phenomenal – for his major essay project in AP English, he researched and wrote a remarkable study of visual imagery in the works of Edgar Allan Poe.

Alex's wide-ranging intellect is such that he would be bored by most freshman- and sophomore-level Liberal Arts courses. He is ready to assume and excel in upper division classwork, and possesses the self-motivation to successfully create and execute an independent course of honors study.

Alex's academic strengths are complemented by his demonstrated leadership skills – he was our band's drum major for two years and served as Vice President of the Student Council and Editor of our high school yearbook. He is also very active in his church and in the Sierra Student Coalition.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information to strengthen Alex's candidacy for the College Scholars Program.

He has a very special spark, and I trust he will go far in making our world a better place.

Sincerely,
