Dear Scholarship Committee:

I wish to recommend Alex Bloom for the Easton Area School Board Community Service 
Scholarship. I am the Community Outreach and Volunteer Coordinator at the Center for Animal 
Health & Welfare. We are a life-saving adoption facility dedicated to finding permanent homes 
for Northampton County's homeless pets. With the help of dedicated volunteers like Ms. 
Bloom, I am proud to say we are successful in nurturing the animals in our care while 
finding them their forever homes.

The eligibility requirements for the Community Service scholarship state that recipients must 
demonstrate their commitment to and involvement in public service. In this regard, Ms. 
Bloom has dedicated her time at the center taking care of the needs of our cat residents. 
As part of her volunteerism, Ms. Bloom assisted cat staff personnel in the daily routine of 
cleaning/sanitizing living areas, providing food and water, and ensuring an enriching, interactive 
environment for the felines. Ms. Bloom has also donated items such as blankets and pet 
dishes; and she has also prepared special food items for the Center's Thanksgiving dinner for 
the animals. Her dedication to the Center as a volunteer is certainly appreciated and worthy of 
recognition.

For these reasons, I can recommend Alex Bloom without reservation for receiving this 
scholarship. She has certainly demonstrated a willingness to get involved and help those that 
otherwise cannot help themselves. The Easton Area School District should be proud they have 
students like Ms. Bloom who are willing to come to the aid of others.

Thank you for your time and consideration 
Sincerely,

Frank P. Kutch
Community Outreach and Volunteer Coordinator
