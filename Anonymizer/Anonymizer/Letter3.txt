Dear Sir/Madam,

It is my great pleasure to write this letter in support of Alex Bloom’s application for the Lincoln Scholarship. I got to know Alex one year ago as his 11th-grade mathematics teacher. Alex was also a dedicated member of the math’s club, which gained lots of fo reputation in the entire zone. His focus and dedication to learning always impressed me. Alex’s ability to tackle some of the most challenging arithmetic was impressive. Besides, he never hesitated to seek help whenever he missed a concept.

Additionally, I was impressed by the way he collaboratively worked with his classmates. Alex believed in teamwork. And this is something I witnessed during group discussions. Other than that, he is respectful, honest, caring, and gets along with people well. At some point, he was willing to help fellow students who needed assistance.

Currently, Alex has a vision of joining Oxford University to further his studies in applied mathematics. As his former teacher, I have strong confidence he will succeed with flying colors. Alex comes from a humble family who has consistently offered him support. However, as he plans to encounter his next learning phase, things can get a bit south. The financial amount associated with his enrollment at the university could put lots of strain on his family. My worry is that this can shutter down his ambitions and dreams.

Over the four years of his high schooling, Alex has worked as a shop attendant to support his parents’ meager income. But this didn’t prevent him from scoring highly in his academics. Overall, I can say that Alex is a first-grade student.

His hard work and effort will get him whenever he wants to achieve. Therefore, I can confidently say that he is well-deserving of this scholarship more than ever. Please feel free to contact me at maria@email.com if you have any other questions or concerns.

Sincerely

Maria Jones
