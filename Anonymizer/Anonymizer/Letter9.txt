Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Rayanne Parry. I am the Christian Education Director at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church 
in Wilson Borough, Easton. PA, I am responsible for youth programs in our church including Sunday 
School, Vacation Bible School, and Youth Fellowship activities:

I have known Miss Alex Bloom since she was 3 years old. She has been actively involved in 
our youth ministry since then. During her elementary and middle school years, Alex was an 
enthusiastic student who enjoyed participating in extra activities such as our Children's Choir, 
Christmas Pageants, and Easter plays. She happily volunteered to sing, wear costumes, and read scripts 
to our congregation members.

As a high school student, Alex continues to play an active role in our programs. She helps 
brainstorm Vacation Bible School ideas and helps prepare sets and scenery. She shares her time 
working with the preschoolers, guiding them in their projects and activities. She also gladly helps with 
outreach activities and assists with worship as needed. She participates in all this while also 
maintaining participation in extracurricular activities such as marching band, gymnastics, and a job.

I feel, as she prepares for her college education, Alex will continue to be a pleasant young lady 
who works hard to achieve her goals. She is full of energy and has a good sense of responsibility. She 
has a love of young children, and she will become an awesome teacher someday.

Please contact me if you have any questions or need more information, 

Sincerely, 
Rayatine Party
