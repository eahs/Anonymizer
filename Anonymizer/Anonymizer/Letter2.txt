To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter to recommend Petra Lambert for the Night Owl Scholarship with Phi Delta Phi. I was her 12th grade Childhood Development teacher and have known her for the last four years.

As a student, Ms. Lambert demonstrated a love of learning and the level of commitment necessary to succeed in college and beyond. As an educator, I am happy to be able to provide this recommendation for such a deserving student who has inspired so many others with her volunteer work with children. I have great respect for her abilities and truly believe that she is a deserving candidate that you will be proud to have representing your fraternity of educators.

Ms. Lambert is an excellent student who has achieved all A’s this year, making her a School Board Scholar for the 2018-2019 School Year. She volunteers with students once a week, tutoring with our elementary schools. Petra is an incredibly motivated student and even attends lectures on education on the weekends when she is able.
 
In addition to having firsthand knowledge of her academic commitment, I am also familiar with her educational goals, as well as the challenges she will face when it comes to funding college tuition. I cannot think of anyone more deserving and I can wholeheartedly recommend her application.

I feel certain that you will be just as impressed with Petra as the staff at Nevermore High School has been over the past four years. I strongly encourage you to consider her for this scholarship.
 
Please contact me with any questions and let me know if I can provide any additional information in support of this deserving student. You may reach me at 555-555-5555 or vjones@email.com.

Regards,

Victoria Jones
