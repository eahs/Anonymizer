Letter of Recommendation for Alex Bloom 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is my pleasure to offer this letter of recommendation for Alex Bloom. I have 
known Alex for over one year. I taught her AP Chemistry and Organic 
Chemistry during last school year. Alex is among the top ten students that I 
have ever taught in the last seventeen years. She picks up science concepts very 
quickly, and applies them to solve problems. She is perhaps more motivated to 
learn than any other student that I have ever taught. She immediately asks good 
questions when necessary.

Alex is very mature and always pleasant. She interacts very well with adults 
and with her peers. Other students reach out to her. She consistently helps other 
students. She even instructs other students on how to effectively use their time. She  
is a well - rounded individual. I believe that she will succeed, and that she will 
contribute to the institutions that she associates herself with throughout her career.

I thank you for your time and consideration on behalf of Alex. If you need to 
discuss anything, please email me at pacchioli@eastonsd.org.

Sincerely,

Louis Pacchioli
Chemistry Teacher
Easton Area High School
